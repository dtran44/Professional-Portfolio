# Diana Tran - Professional-Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a Professional Portfolio from scratch for prospetive employers to view my sample works. The webpage has the following sections: 
1. About me section 
2. Presentation of my sample works 
3. My Contact details

I learnt how to build a webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. Specifically, I used the following: 
- Flex box functionality in CSS to create a responsive webpage for various screens and devices
- CSS to style the webpage such as setting fonts, colors, background colors, padding, margins, height, text-aligns, etc.
- Accessible HTML code
- Navigation links to allow the employer to scroll to the corresponding section
- A link to my main work which takes the user to the deployed website
